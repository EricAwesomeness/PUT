# PUT
This PowerShell script, labeled as version 6.13.0, serves as a utility toolkit for handling common Active Directory (AD) tasks. It's designed to assist service technicians in managing user accounts efficiently. Here's a breakdown of its main features and functionality:

GUI Interface: The script utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Windows Forms to provide an interactive experience for the user.

Functionality:

Account Check: Allows users to verify user account details such as name, employee number, last password change date, and account status (enabled/disabled).
Account Unlock: Unlocks user accounts across multiple domain controllers if they are locked out.
Set Password Of Day: Sets the password of a specified user to the password of the day on multiple domain controllers.*
Set Password To Expired: Marks the password of a specified user as expired.
PC Lookup: Allows users to search for computers by entering part or all of the computer name.
Search For Computers: Searches for registered devices in the TAHR location based on the entered computer name.
Work History: Displays a history of actions performed using the toolkit.
Help Menu: Provides information and instructions for using various functions within the toolkit.
Auto-Completion: Utilizes an AutoCompleteStringCollection to provide auto-completion functionality for user input based on existing AD user names and payroll numbers.
Job Parallelization: Utilizes PowerShell's job parallelization features to unlock user accounts across multiple domain controllers simultaneously, improving efficiency.
*(This is due to replication being broken in this environment causing it to take up to 20 minutes sometimes. I have the rights as a tech to create a script but not to fix the domain replication.)
